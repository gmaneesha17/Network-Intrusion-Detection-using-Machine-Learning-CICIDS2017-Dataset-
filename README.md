This project implements a Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) using the CICIDS2017 dataset. The dataset contains realistic network traffic with both normal activity and multiple types of cyberattacks (DDoS, PortScan, Web Attacks, Infiltration, etc.).

The notebook explores, preprocesses, and analyzes the dataset, followed by training and evaluating machine learning models to detect malicious traffic effectively.
